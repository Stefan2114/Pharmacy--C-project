# Pharmacy


## A pharmacy application written in C language that manages the storage of the medicines!

This project is an example that was build as a homework for one of my assignment in the second semester of my faculty. It's main objective was to make a pharmacy aplication using my own dynamic vector implementation


## Features:
* Add delete or update a medicine
* See all available medicines containing a given string
* See only those medicines depending on a given criteria

## Implementation:
* Layered architecture
* Errors handling
* Dynamic memory allocation
* Dynamic vector implementation using void pointer
* Unlimited undo redo using memento design pattern
